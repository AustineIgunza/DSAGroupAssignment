# Linked List in Python

This is a simple Python project that shows how a **Linked List** works.

## What It Does

- Adds items to the end of the list (`append`)
- Adds items to the beginning of the list (`prepend`)
- Prints all the items in the list

## How It Works

- Each item in the list is called a node
- Each node stores a number and points to the next one
- The list starts from the head(first node)
